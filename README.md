# grnAnnotation
GRN annotations. Where each folder is a PMID, "description.txt" contains notes and relevent information about about the paper and "sif.txt" is the grn interactions. The image files are the main image from which the information was taken. 

## TODO:
1. get method standard symbol
2. get interaction type (for sif file), for example just written as tfPromoter at present 
3. finalize description.txt format for reading (very informal now)
